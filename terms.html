        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 10, 2026</p>
        <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using Axion ("Service", "Bot"). By using Axion,
            you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Axion is a helper bot designed for the Discord platform, providing utility, automation, and moderation
            features to enhance user experience on Discord servers. Axion is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
            sponsored by Discord Inc.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>

            <li>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age of digital consent in your country) to use the
                Bot, in compliance with Discord's Terms of Service.</li>
            <li>If you are making any payments for Premium features, you must be at least 18 years old or have the
                permission of a parent or legal guardian.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Premium Services & Payments</h2>

            <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> All payments are processed securely by third-party providers (such
                as Stripe or Razorpay). Axion does not directly process payments or store any credit card information on
                its servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Services:</strong> Premium subscriptions grant access to enhanced features within the
                Bot. These are digital services and do not include physical goods.</li>

                unless required by law or under exceptional circumstances at our sole discretion.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time via the payment provider or
                through our support channels. Access to Premium features will continue until the end of the current
                billing cycle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. User Conduct & Acceptable Use</h2>

            <li>Using the Bot to distribute spam, malware, or illegal content.</li>
        </ul>
