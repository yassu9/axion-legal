        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 10, 2026</p>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Axion ("we", "us", or "our") collects,
            uses, and protects your information when you use our discord bot.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide our services effectively:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discord User ID and Username:</strong> To identify you within the bot's system and link your
                data (e.g., premium status, moderation logs).</li>
            <li><strong>Discord Server ID and Name:</strong> To manage server-specific configurations and settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Command Usage Data:</strong> Logs of commands executed to improve performance and debug issues.
            </li>
            <li><strong>User-Generated Content (Configuration):</strong> Any custom settings, auto-responses, or
                configurations you explicitly set up within the bot.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>We respect your privacy and do NOT collect sensitive personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Passwords:</strong> We never have access to your Discord account password.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Messages (DMs):</strong> We do not read, store, or monitor your private messages unless
                you explicitly use a command in DMs that requires it.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> We do not store credit card numbers, bank account details, or
                sensitive payment data. All payments are processed securely by our third-party payment providers
                (Stripe/Razorpay).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the Axion bot and its features.</li>
            <li>To process transactions and manage premium subscriptions.</li>
            <li>To improve, personalize, and expand our services.</li>
            <li>To detect and prevent fraud, abuse, and security issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized
            access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or
            electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties, except as
            described below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share data with trusted third-party service providers (e.g.,
                hosting, payment processing) who assist us in operating our services, provided they agree to keep this
                information confidential.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in
                response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Your Data Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to access, update, or delete the information we hold about you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You may request the deletion of your data from our systems by contacting
                us. Upon request, we will remove your identifiable data, except where we are required to retain it for
                legal or legitimate business purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party websites or services (e.g., Discord, Stripe). We are not
            responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third parties. We encourage you to review their
            privacy policies.</p>
